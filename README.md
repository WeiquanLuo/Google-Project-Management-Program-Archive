# Personal Closing Report

Executive Summary:

 After a long period of struggling for the thesis of my master degree, my adviser pointed out that I lacked project management skill. I attend this Google Project Management Certificate for the following purpose:
-	To understand what the skill set, process, methodologies are commonly used in modern project management, as well as how to apply them.
-	To understand what went wrong during my thesis project and reduced efficiency and effectiveness.

Key Accomplishments:
-	By going through a complete life cycle of a project, I now confident about leading a project in the domain I am expertised in, that is data science.
-	I summarized all the course material into a knowledge map for future reference.

Lessons Learned:
-	The tools and methodologies only help to manage projects, including organizing, recording and reminding.
-	Beside tools and methodologies, the most effective way of project management is communication, including sympathy talk, active listening, and face regulation, and emotional regulation.

Next Steps:
-	 Apply some useful tools and methodologies into my current projects to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
-	 Constantly apply the thought process of project management in daily live to improve life quality
